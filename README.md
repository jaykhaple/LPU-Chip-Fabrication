# LPU-Chip-Fabrication
This is our first step towords the fabrication of Integrated ciruit designed by Btech student's of LPU with the guidence of Dr. Sobhit Saxena.

This Repository consisits of Layout desing i.e(.gds) file  of inverter with the help of 180nm technology file(gpdk180nm).

Please check the whether the file shared is sufficent for the fabrication of IC. If not then please provide the check list of files which are requied for the chip fabrication.
