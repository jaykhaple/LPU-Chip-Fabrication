# LPU-Chip-Fabrication
This is our first step towards the fabrication of Integrated circuit designed by Btech students of LPU with the guidance of Dr. Sobhit Saxena.


This Repository consists of Layout design i.e(.gds) file of inverter with the help of 180nm technology file(gpdk180nm).


Please check the whether the file shared is sufficient for the fabrication of IC. If not then please provide the check list of files which are required for the chip fabrication.
